# catalog-and-review-app

This app is a digital library that allows users to catalog and organize the books they have read, along with the ability to add their own personal reviews for each book. Users can easily search and sort through their catalog, which can be useful for remembering which books they have read. The app may also include additional features such as the ability to rate books, share reviews with friends, and discover new books based on the user's reading history.

This app is a Java-based application that utilizes a SQL database to store and manage the books, reviews, and other relevant information. The database chosen for this app is MySQL. The app uses Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API to establish a connection between the Java code and the MySQL database, allowing me to execute SQL statements and interact with relational databases. By using Java and JDBC, I am hoping to leverage the power and flexibility of SQL while also utilizing the platform independence of Java, to make it run on multiple operating systems, including Android OS in the foreseeable future.
